# Please learn how to use Gautomatch before using this script
# It is designed as a useful tool rather than an excuse not to
#
# Run this script from the same place you would run Relion (top directory)
#
# First a directory is made for running gautomatch
mkdir gauto_templates

# Moving into the 'gauto_templates' directory, symbolic links are made to micrographs
cd gauto_templates
ln -sf ../Micrographs/*.mrc .

# Variables
echo What is the apix of the Micrographs?
read apixM

echo What is the particle diameter \(\Ã…\)?
read diameter_var

# Th4e templates should be in the 'top' directory.
echo What is the apix of the templates?
read apixT

echo What is the name of the template stack?
read template_stack

# Gautomatch 0.53 is run with a Gaussian blob.
# All required commands should have been added.
# Any additional commands can be added manually.

# Here we wait for Gautomatch to finish

# Moving to the 'Micrographs' directory we can make new symbolic links to the
